# pygame

My first Pygame project. The object of this maze is to get the slice of cake to the nyancat with out touching the walls. 
Additionally, I wanted to have a game that looked simply and straightforward but was very difficult to win. I did this by creating "speed traps" throughout the maze. These speed traps are the same color as the background (to make them invisible to the user).
