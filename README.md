# pygame

My first Pygame project. The objective of this maze is to move the slice of cake with the arrow keys to the nyancat without touching the maze walls. 
Additionally, I wanted the game to look simple and straightforward but in practice was very difficult to win. I did this by creating "speed traps" throughout the maze. These speed traps are the same color as the background (to make them invisible to the user). The speed traps increase the amount of pixels the sprite moves with each arrowkey event.
